---


I started practicing hatha yoga in 1991 and started teaching yoga in 1999 and have studied with internationally recognized teachers around the world.

I'm a Yasodhara Yoga Teacher and a CPD teacher for the British Wheel of Yoga. I teach The Hidden Language of Hatha Yoga,  Kundalini Yoga and Dream Yoga workshops in the Yasodhara Yoga tradition. 

I discovered one of Swami Radhaâ€™s books in the local library (In the Company of the Wise) in May 2015, and by the time I was half way through, knew that I had to go to Yasodhara Ashram to do the three month Yoga Development Course, which I attended in 2016. I returned to the UK after a five month stay. I went back to the ashram in 2017 for the Dream and Kundalini Training, in 2018 for the Hidden Language of Hatha Yoga Training, and in October 2019 took four of my friends and students to the ashram, three of whom participated in the 10 Days of Yoga Journey https://www.yasodhara.org/study/10-day-yoga-journey/ and one, in the One Month Karma Yoga Programme https://www.yasodhara.org/karma-yoga/one-month-introduction/

The Yasodhara teachings have changed my life in extraordinary ways, and continue to do so. I am deeply committed to bringing them forward in my European community both in person and on line, so that others can experience these transformational practices.
