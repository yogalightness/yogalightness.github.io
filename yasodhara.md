Yasodhara Yoga is a reflective, spiritual approach to yoga that integrates body, mind and speech. By integrating yogic practices with personal development techniques, Yasodhara Yoga encompasses the teachings of the East and translates them for our Western situation.

Yasodhara Yoga practices will help guide you to your own inner wisdom. The spiritual goal of yoga is self-realization through exploring the question, “Who am I?” In Yasodhara Yoga classes, students create a personal learning experience using practices to help build a foundation for the inner work necessary on the path of yoga.

Hatha Yoga integrates classical asanas with spiritual practices of mantra and meditation. Offered in small groups, these classes empower students to accept and listen to their bodies. Non-competitive and compassionate, open to all levels.



### Spiritual Lineage

Swami Sivananda Radha

Sylvia Hellman (1911 – 1995) had a visionary experience in Montreal which led her to her guru, Swami Sivananda Saraswati of Rishikesh, India. At his ashram she received intense training in the philosophy and practices of yoga, and in 1956 she was initiated into the sacred order of sanyas to become Swami Sivananda Radha.

At her guru’s request she returned to the West to establish an ashram for the study of yoga. Swami Radha’s major focus was to interpret the ancient yogic teachings of the East so that they could be understood and applied in the daily life of Westerners. She set high ethical standards and encouraged students to develop quality in their lives and manifest their own ideals. Her teachings are based on building character as a foundation so that the energy gained through spiritual practice is directly wisely.

A pioneer in the North American yoga movement of the mid 20th century, Swami Radha’s teachings continue to inspire the yogis of today.
