![Hidden Language Hatha Yoga](https://yasodharayoga.org/europe/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/06/Hidden-Language-300x141.png)

**Hidden Language Hatha Yoga** takes the practice of Hatha Yoga far beyond a
series of physical exercises. It is a gentle and meditative style of
Hatha that respects the body as a spiritual tool. By working with
metaphor, symbolism, imagery and visualization, the 'hidden' messages of
each asana are revealed.

Hidden Language starts with the very personal -- your observations, your
mind, your body, your relationship to the world. And it expands out to
the universal, to the mythologies of our cultures, to the subtle force
sustaining all life. The asanas are practiced not only for their
physical benefits, but also to understand the psychological and symbolic
meanings, to demonstrate how each asana can increase spiritual
awareness. For those accustomed to physically intense or rigorous Hatha
traditions, Hidden Language will be a change of pace, a chance to go
deeper into the body and the mystical potential of each asana.

The atmosphere of a class is quiet and self-directed. The instructor
offers principles -- such as spinal awareness, moving with the breath,
relaxing in the movements, and observing physical, mental and emotional
responses -- but you are given responsibility for your own self and your
own insights. Students take time between asanas to write down
observations. At the end of class there is a deep relaxation, then the
class gathers together to share their reflections. Wear loose
comfortable clothing and bring a journal.

If you are new to Yasodhara Yoga Practices and would like to know more
about them, to read more [Click here.](https://yasodharayoga.org/yasodhara-yoga/)

You'll need a pen, journal and mat.
