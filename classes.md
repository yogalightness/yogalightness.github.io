Upcoming Workshops.

#### A morning of Hidden Language of Hatha Yoga 10-12 and  afternoon of Dream Yoga 1.30-4.30pm
SATURDAY  8TH JUNE

On Line and in person in Aylsham Norfolk

The Hidden Language of Hatha Yoga takes the practice of Yoga far beyond a series of physical exercises. It is a gentle and meditative style of Hatha that respects the body as a spiritual tool. By working with metaphor, symbolism, imagery and visualization, the ‘hidden’ messages of each asana are revealed.
Hidden Language starts with the very personal – your observations, your mind, your body, your relationship to the world. And it expands out to the universal, to the mythologies of our cultures, to the subtle force sustaining all life. The asanas are practiced not only for their physical benefits, but also to understand the psychological and symbolic meanings, to demonstrate how each asana can increase spiritual awareness. For those accustomed to physically intense or rigorous Hatha traditions, Hidden Language will be a change of pace, a chance to go deeper into the body and the mystical potential of each asana.
The atmosphere of a class is quiet and self-directed. The instructor offers principles – such as spinal awareness, moving with the breath, relaxing in the movements, and observing physical, mental and emotional responses – but you are given responsibility for your own self and your own insights. Students take time between asanas to write down observations. At the end of class there is a deep relaxation, then the class gathers together to share their reflections. Wear loose comfortable clothing and bring a journal and a pen.

When: 10-12.00

#### Dream Yoga 
is a way to get in touch with your Higher Self through the involvement and analysis of your dreams. Analyzing the content of dreams is the most direct means of learning to understand your self.By combining yoga techniques and practices with an investigation of symbolism, Dream Yoga opens up a dialogue with the unconscious mind. It is a detailed method of interpreting the messages of your subconscious to create change in your waking life.The yogic method of working with dreams emphasizes independence and stresses understanding yourself as an individual. Dreams are personal creations, and as you study them you learn the language of your unconscious. Making your own discoveries is a very joyful process and gives you the courage to go on. By finding answers within, you gain self-confidence.

Exploring the First (Base) Cakra, Mulhadhara Saturday 6th July 1.30-4.30pm

The first cakra is pure energy. How do you use your energy? What choices lie before you right now?

Kundalini Yoga, approached with the method developed by Swami Radha, is a well-structured practice that leads to the expansion of consciousness and the development of the potential that resides untapped within each of us.
By reflecting on the images of the chakras and exploring the symbolism, elements, senses and mantras associated with them, we can clarify the mind and access intuition and inner wisdom, to understand and guide our lives.

Join us for this exploration of the First Cakra in the Kundalini System either online or in person in Aylsham Norfolk.

Cost: £15-20 depending on means for the morning only. £20-30 depending on means for the afternoon only. £28-45 depending on means for whole day.

**The Hidden Language of Hatha Yoga** takes the practice of Hatha Yoga far beyond a

Hatha that respects the body as a spiritual tool. By working with
metaphor, symbolism, imagery and visualization, the 'hidden' messages of
each asana are revealed.

Hidden Language starts with the very personal -- your observations, your

The atmosphere of a class is quiet and self-directed. The instructor
