Sunday 6th October


A morning of Hidden Language of Hatha Yoga 10-12 Theme TBC

This session is part of the Yasodhara Yoga European Network retreat weekend. More details coming soon.
On Line and in person in Aylsham Norfolk. You can attend for the day or participate in just one of the workshops.

The Hidden Language of Hatha Yoga takes the practice of Yoga far beyond a series of physical exercises. It is a gentle and meditative style of Hatha that respects the body as a spiritual tool. By working with metaphor, symbolism, imagery and visualization, the ‘hidden’ messages of each asana are revealed.
Hidden Language starts with the very personal – your observations, your mind, your body, your relationship to the world. And it expands out to the universal, to the mythologies of our cultures, to the subtle force sustaining all life. The asanas are practiced not only for their physical benefits, but also to understand the psychological and symbolic meanings, to demonstrate how each asana can increase spiritual awareness. For those accustomed to physically intense or rigorous Hatha traditions, Hidden Language will be a change of pace, a chance to go deeper into the body and the mystical potential of each asana.
The atmosphere of a class is quiet and self-directed. The instructor offers principles – such as spinal awareness, moving with the breath, relaxing in the movements, and observing physical, mental and emotional responses – but you are given responsibility for your own self and your own insights. Students take time between asanas to write down observations. At the end of class there is a deep relaxation, then the class gathers together to share their reflections. Wear loose comfortable clothing and bring a journal and a pen.

Cost: £15-20. We would much rather you paid what you can afford than not attend the classes because of  financial restrictions. Click here for the [PayPal link](http://paypal.me/yogalightness) or email JaneCatherine here](mailto:jane.a@yasodharayoga.org)for BACs details.
