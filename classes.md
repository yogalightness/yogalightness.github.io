See below for practicalities.



Practicalities.
Classes start and finish promptly. Please arrive 10 minutes before the start of class.

Wear loose comfortable clothing. Dress in layers as the temperature may vary depending on how still or otherwise you are during class. Bring a mat and a blanket.

If you wish to try a class before committing to a series, you are welcome to pay for one class, and then pay the balance for the rest of the term the next week.

Please bring the correct amount as change may not be available.

Concessions available for genuine cases of hardship.

Unfortunately, due to the cost of overheads, refunds or credits cannot be given for missed classes.

Satsang may be offered after class.

Satsang is offered in the Saraswati lineage tradition, and includes aarti, prayers, such as the metta sutra, chanting, and either a talk or a reading on an aspect of spiritual life…It’s non denominational, open to all, and a celebration of the light within everyone.

‘Satsang, means literally, “in the company of the wise” -the wise being those who seek a deeper meaning in life and who sincerely want to make progress towards their own ideals’. ‘It is a time of prayer, reflection and chanting, a time to see the personal challenges of life from a different perspective’…
